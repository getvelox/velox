# ADR-059: Guard invoice mutations while a payment is in flight

**Date:** 2026-06-22
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

An end-to-end audit asked: *which paths mutate an invoice while its payment is "in flight"?* — where **in flight** = `payment_status ∈ {processing, unknown}`: the charge is open at the provider (processing — e.g. off-session SCA `requires_action`) or its outcome is genuinely ambiguous (unknown — a 5xx/timeout that may or may not have captured). In both, **the captured amount is not yet known.** The audit found two distinct classes of bug, neither guarded.

**Class 1 — status-strand (operator-reachable today).** Three status writers flipped status + reversed tax with **no** `payment_status` check:

- `invoice.Service.Void` — voiding an invoice whose charge later succeeds strands captured money on a voided invoice and reverses tax on a sale that completed.
- `invoice.Service.MarkUncollectible` — `MarkPaid` *is* allowed from `uncollectible` (the "wrote it off but paid after all" recovery), so reversing tax + flipping to uncollectible, then the charge settling, leaves the tenant **under-remitting** output tax on a real collected sale.
- dunning `resolveRun` (`manually_resolved`) — called the **raw store** `UpdateStatus(Voided)`, bypassing `service.Void` entirely: a *second, less-guarded void writer* that reversed no tax and emitted no `invoice.voided` event. Plus `RecordOfflinePayment` guarded only `processing`, not `unknown` (double-collect window).

**Class 2 — amount-drift ("Part B").** The automated ADR-050 unpaid-source clawback (subscription cancel/downgrade/qty-decrease/item-removal) selects a finalized funding invoice via `FindFundingInvoicesForPeriod`, which filters only `status` (not `payment_status`). An in-flight source is classified *unpaid* and its `amount_due` is **reduced immediately**. Then at settle, `MarkPaid` records `amount_paid = amount_due` (the now-lowered figure) → **under-record**, undersized refund cap. Naively *skipping* the relief instead trades that for a silent **over-charge** (the customer paid the full amount and never gets the unused portion back). You cannot correctly size the clawback until the charge reaches a terminal state.

**Reachability (honest).** On **cards** — Velox's default (`Confirm+OffSession`) — the in-flight window is *seconds*: the charge settles inline or fails. So a mutation colliding with it is rare. The window becomes *days* — and the collision routine — under **asynchronous bank methods (ACH / SEPA Direct Debit)**, which legitimately sit `processing` for 1–5 business days and are the standard way B2B annual contracts pay. So Class 2 is *"rare on cards today, regular the moment ACH/SEPA is enabled."* Stripe enforces the same rule it implies: *"When an invoice has open or paid payments, you can't void, edit, or mark it uncollectible,"* and *"open invoices can't have a credit note with a pending payment_intent."*

## Decision

One canonical predicate, in-flight guards on the status writers, a single void writer, and — for the automated clawback — **defer the issue, not the create**.

**Canonical predicate.** `domain.InvoicePaymentStatus.IsInFlight()` = `processing || unknown`. Every guard routes through it (including the prior operator credit-note gate, #295), so the definition can't drift across call sites — the drift this audit found.

**Class 1 — guards (block, Stripe-parity).**
1. `Void` and `MarkUncollectible` reject in-flight with `InvalidState` (→409), placed **before** `reverseInvoiceTax` so no reversal fires on an in-flight invoice. The reconciler resolves the charge; the operator retries.
2. `RecordOfflinePayment` widened from `== processing` to `IsInFlight()` (closes the `unknown` double-collect window).
3. **Single void writer.** Dunning `resolveRun` (`manually_resolved`) now voids through `invoice.Service.Void` (a narrow `InvoiceVoider` dep, wired post-construction like `SetInvoiceUncollectibleMarker`), inheriting the status guards, the in-flight guard, the tax reversal, and the single-writer `invoice.voided` event. Its inline credit-reversal + PI-cancel now run **only after the void succeeds** — otherwise an in-flight invoice (whose void the service refuses) would still get its live PI canceled, defeating the guard.

**Class 2 — defer-until-settle (the automated clawback).** The automated path cannot 409 a cancel/downgrade back to a human, so it **defers** rather than reduces. The key insight: `Issue()` already branches on the source's `payment_status` *at issue time* (succeeded → credit/refund channel; not-succeeded → reduce `amount_due`). So we defer *when `Issue()` runs*, not the create:

1. **`Issue()` is the single chokepoint.** Before claiming the draft→issued CAS it reads the source invoice and:
   - if the source is **voided/uncollectible** (annulled after the draft was created) → **voids the draft** (pure status flip) instead of issuing — the void already reversed the tax and zeroed the receivable, so issuing would double-reverse tax.
   - if the source is **in flight** → **no-op**, leaving the draft `status='draft' AND issue_pending`. Every issue trigger (engine `CreateAndIssueAdjustment`, the post-commit `issueClawbackDrafts`, the reconciler) defers identically — so no clawback create-site needs its own gate.
2. **`CreateAndIssueAdjustment` marks the draft `issue_pending`** so a deferred (or post-commit-failed) issue is recoverable by the reconciler.
3. **Reconciler issues once the source settles.** `RetryPendingClawbackIssue`'s scan (`ListPendingClawbackDrafts`) gains a correlated `NOT EXISTS` that skips drafts whose source `payment_status IN ('processing','unknown')`, and **drops the prior 24h `updated_at` window** — an ACH/SEPA source can sit `processing` for days, so a fixed horizon would age a deferred draft out of the scan and silently drop the relief. The source-terminal gate is now the only eligibility predicate; a settled source makes the draft eligible regardless of age.
4. **Engine void-skip.** `relieveUnpaidPrebill`'s fully-unused **void** branch is skipped for an in-flight source (it falls through to the deferring `CreateAndIssueAdjustment` for the full amount). At settle the draft issues down the right channel: paid → full credit; failed → `amount_due → 0` (the same end-state the void produced).

**No migration.** The draft row + `issue_pending` (migration 0121) *is* the durable deferred record; the source invoice's `payment_status` is the trigger signal. A dedicated table was rejected (a dual-write reconciliation surface — the recurring money-bug shape). Source-exclusion in `FindFundingInvoicesForPeriod` was rejected (it hard-fails a single-funding-source downgrade and over-credits survivors via redistribution).

**Reconciler-only, not a settle-hook.** A hook from `payment` into `creditnote`/`billing` would violate the zero-cross-peer-import rule, and the draft→issued CAS already guarantees exactly-once however many triggers race. Latency is up to one scheduler tick (~1h prod) *after* a charge that already sat in flight for days — negligible. Matches the 0121 precedent (scheduler tick, no settle hook).

## Consequences

- **Parts A + B closed for full capture.** The operator vector was gated (Part A, #295); the automated vector now defers → `amount_due` stays full while in-flight → `MarkPaid` records the full captured amount → the reconciler credits the unused share. No under-record, no over-charge.
- **Part C (partial capture) is not reachable in Velox.** `MarkPaid` records `amount_paid = amount_due`. That equals the captured amount under Velox's PaymentIntent-only **full-capture** model — Velox exposes no partial/manual-capture flow. If one is ever added, recording `amount_paid` from the PI's `amount_received` is the correct source of truth; until then this is a theoretical vector, not a live gap.
- **Genuinely-wedged payment → deferred draft waits (observability follow-up).** If a charge *never* reaches terminal (e.g. a `requires_action` PI nobody authenticates or cancels), the deferred draft sits unissued. It is **not lost** — it is durably captured and auto-issues the instant the payment settles, and a wedged payment is independently visible (the invoice stuck in `processing`; the tenant unpaid). A dedicated **stale-deferred-draft alarm** (surface a draft deferred > N days so an operator can cancel/await the wedged PI, which then auto-resolves the clawback) is a deferred *observability* follow-up — it does not affect whether the books are correct or the customer is eventually made whole.

  **Amended 2026-07-31 ([ADR-107](107-unknown-is-terminal-until-a-human.md)).**
  "Auto-issues the instant the payment settles" assumed every payment eventually
  settles. A **parked** invoice never does — `unknown` with no PaymentIntent id
  means nothing can name the attempt, so there is no webhook and no sweep to end
  the wait. The deferral was therefore permanent, and silently so: the scan's
  eligibility predicate tested payment state alone, so the draft could not reach
  the code that decides its fate, produced no error logs (deferred drafts log
  nothing, by design), and sat in the pending-drafts gauge forever. Writing the
  invoice off did not release it either, because a write-off deliberately does
  not change `payment_status`.

  Fixed by adding a **status** term to that predicate: a terminal invoice defers
  nothing. The outcome is unchanged from what this ADR already specified — the
  existing orphan guard voids a draft whose source was voided or written off,
  since an invoice that collected nothing has nothing to claw back, and the
  customer is made whole by not being charged. The bug was reachability, not
  behaviour. Pinned by `TestListPendingClawbackDrafts_ParkedSourceReleasedByWriteOff`.
- **Industry parity.** Operator block matches Stripe exactly. The automated defer-then-act-on-settled-state matches Lago's terminate-subscription rule (*"the unused paid amount is refunded; any unpaid unused amount is credited back"*) — Velox just sequences it after settlement instead of guessing the channel mid-flight.

## Deferred / follow-ups

| Item | Affects correctness? | Trigger |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| Stale-deferred-draft alarm (surface a clawback draft wedged on a never-settling payment) | No — obligation is durably captured and auto-issues on settle; wedged payments are independently visible | operability hardening / first ACH-SEPA design partner |
| Part C — record `amount_paid` from the PI's `amount_received` | No (not reachable: full-capture only) | partial-capture support |
| `reverseInvoiceTax` failure recovery (ADR-057 §Deferred b) | Yes, on a transient reversal failure | first real tax-filing customer |
| ADR-057 partial-issue window (non-idempotent `ApplyCreditNote` after the status flip) — Part B **inherits, does not widen** it (the reconciler only re-drives `status='draft'`) | Yes, on a side-effect failure after the CAS | making `ApplyCreditNote` idempotent (separate PR) |
